# Winton.Blogs.TPLActor

The code in this repository is written to accompany the [blog article](https://tech.winton.com/blog/2017/03/a-tpl-actor-pattern) on writing an actor pattern that
integrates with the .NET Task Parallel Library.

## Note on building ##

Version `1.0` of the [.NET Core build tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/tools/) is required to build the source code.
To build from Visual Studio you'll need VS 2017.
